1 Basics
âœ… Write basic programs (main(), cin, cout)
âœ… Use conditionals (if, else, switch)
âœ… Use loops (for, while, do-while)
âœ… Define and use functions
âœ… Understand scope and lifetime of variables
âœ… Use arrays and strings

ðŸ“¦ 2. C++ Intermediate Concepts
These are super important before starting serious DSA:
âœ… Pointers (important for linked lists, trees)
âœ… Functions and parameters (pass by value/reference)
âœ… Recursion
 (DSA heavily uses recursion)
âœ… Arrays, 2D arrays
âœ… Basic input/output
âœ… Strings and string manipulation
âœ… Time and space complexity (O(n), O(log n) etc.)


ðŸ”© 3. Object-Oriented Concepts (optional early on)
You donâ€™t need full OOP for starting DSA, but basic class knowledge helps later:
Classes and Objects
Constructors
public, private
Member functions
